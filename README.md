# Sun illumination measurement system
The electronic integrator is constructed based on Atmel AVR Xmega 8 bits microprocessor that is used to measure, convert and store solar irradiation data with the use of precise photoelectric pyranometer. The analog electronic signal is converted with A/D converter in the CPU and stored in the flash memory. The programmed user interface allows for simple samples taking for
longer time period in the harsh environment. The couple of weeks measurements are done with reference pyranometer. The results show high precision with only 1% error of the constructed electronic module.
